# An Extreme Value Theory Approach to Financial Risk Modeling

This repository includes the code used in one of the master's projects **"An Extreme Value Theory Approach to Financial Risk Modeling"** by Khalil Belghouat.

In this project, we apply VaR and ES models, historical as well as parametric, to one of Morocco stock indices, namely, the MADEX index. In addition, we employ extreme value theory in order to model the tail distribution, left and right, of the stock index daily log-returns.

## Prerequisites

While ```R```, version 4.0.3, and its statistical libraries were used to build all applied models. ```Python```, version 3.7.10, and its ```pandas``` library were used to process the data. The ```R``` script _packages.R_ in the _packages_ folder installs and loads all necessary ```R``` packages. 

All operations, from data preprocessing to model estimation, were carried out on the Google Colaboratory platform.

## Theoretical Background

The concepts of uncertainty, risk and volatility arise naturally in many fields of study concerned with decision-making. One area of study in which these concepts have flourished is finance. Although they are closely related, each concept has its own definition. The American economist Frank Knight (Nov. 7, 1885 - Apr. 15, 1972) defined risk as the situation where there is a measure of probability to guide a choice. Whereas he defined uncertainty as the situation in which this measure of probability is unknown due to cognitive or informational constraints. Banks and other financial institutions are exposed to various types of risk, i.e.: credit risk, market risk, foreign exchange risk, volatility risk, liquidity risk, etc. And so a multiplicity of methods and models were put forward in order to identify its sources, measure it, and manage it.
