# An Extreme Value Theory Approach to Financial Risk Modeling

This repository includes the code used in one of the master's projects **"An Extreme Value Theory Approach to Financial Risk Modeling"** by Khalil Belghouat.

In this project, we apply VaR and ES models, historical as well as parametric, to one of Morocco stock indices, namely, the MADEX index. In addition, we employ extreme value theory in order to model the tail distribution, left and right, of the stock index daily log-returns.

## Prerequisites

While ```R```, version 4.0.3, and its statistical libraries were used to build all applied models. ```Python```, version 3.7.10, and its ```Pandas``` library were used to process the data.

The ```R``` script _packages.R_ in the _packages_ folder installs and loads all necessary ```R``` packages. 

All operations, from data preprocessing to model estimation, were carried out on the Google Colaboratory platform.
