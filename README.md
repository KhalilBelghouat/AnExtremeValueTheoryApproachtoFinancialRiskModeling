# An Extreme Value Theory Approach to Financial Risk Modeling

This repository includes the code used in one of the master's projects **"An Extreme Value Theory Approach to Financial Risk Modeling"** by Khalil Belghouat.

In this project, we apply VaR and ES models to one of Morocco stock indices, namely, the MADEX index. In addition, we employ extreme value theory in order to model the tail distribution, left and right, of the stock index daily log-returns.
